# Welcome to the DGG Political Action Repository

This is a repository of information, made by and for the DGG Political Action group.

## How to use this repository

You can look under the `Guides` or `Talking Points`, to see articles contributors have made to help you in convincing others to stand up for Democracy and how to converse to fight for what we stand for.

## Contributing Guide

I'd recommend having Nix setup on your system with devenv and direnv setup to manage the CLI applications. You'd also need to have Obsidian installed if you'd like to author articles.

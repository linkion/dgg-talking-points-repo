2. Install Obsidian, you can find the download page [here](https://obsidian.md/download)
3. Install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
4. I'd recommend also installing the Github CLI [gh](https://cli.github.com/) for logging into Github with git
	1. After install `gh` and `git`, you may need to restart your computer for your path to update
	2. Open a terminal, login to Github with `gh auth login`, you should see a code that you need to copy and then hit <Enter> to open the URL in your browser, logging in with your Github account then paste the code, then hit allow
	3. run `gh auth setup-git` to setup your git with Github
5. Clone the repository by running `gh repo clone linkion/dgg-talking-points-repo` or `git clone https://github.com/linkion/dgg-talking-points-repo.git` in your terminal inside the folder you want the repo folder to be created
6. Open up Obsidian and open the repo with the "Open folder as vault" button.

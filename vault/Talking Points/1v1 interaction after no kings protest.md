This occurred after a protest when I was packing up my car to leave, no one else was around except for the MAGA debater. He was probably mid-50’s, walked with a medical cane, red polo with tan shorts, he kind of looked like Donald Sutherland in the Hunger Games with glasses. I was carrying a sign which was calling for the impeachment of Trump, and I was wearing a mask+sunglasses.  
  
He started the conversation about 30 feet away from me, asking what Donald Trump has done wrong for him to be impeached? I replied that Trump has clearly broken/ignored the law.  
  
He said I didn’t know what I was talking about, and asked what I knew about law. I replied that I haven’t studied law, I am not a lawyer. He then claimed that he was a lawyer/attorney who specialized in constitutional law and said that I clearly didn’t understand how the government works. The argument he laid out was that Trump hasn’t broken the law because he is in charge of the executive branch so he gets to decide what the law is, while chastising me that I was foolish for not understanding this. By this point he had made it to about the front of my car while I was putting my sign in the trunk.  
  
My reply was that the executive branch is supposed to enforce the laws which are made by congress. He shook his head dismissively at this and said that’s not how the government works. I then asked him what is the point of congress? He said that congress “writes legislation…” I cut him off before he could finish the point and said “yeah, they write legislation, which they vote on to become law. And those laws are the rules we are supposed to follow”. At this point he was a few feet in front of me.  
  
He now snapped back, stating that I was not following the law because my car is parked illegally. There weren’t any “No Parking” signs, but I will admit it did feel ambiguous. However, in the argument I didn’t say anything. After about a 3 second pause he continued by attacking me for being afraid to show my identity because I was wearing a mask. I had come prepared for this talking point: “Yeah? so do ICE agents!” His reply: “No they don’t, they’re on TV”, which replied again with “Yeah, they’re on TV, wearing their masks!” At this point he turns around and walks away, as far as I could tell the interaction was over so I got in my car and left. Overall this interaction took place over the span of about 3-5 minutes.  
  
Some retrospective thoughts:  
I think he tried to chump check me by making stuff up after I told him I wasn’t a lawyer.  
I’m guessing he also lied about being a lawyer to have some sense of authority.  
And I suspect he was intentionally camping where protestors had parked to try and dunk on people.

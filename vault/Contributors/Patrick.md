## About Me
A DGGer since 2018. Was a MAGA conservative because of my Polish parents, but then fell into the pipeline, watching libertarian people like John Stossel, then found Destiny, opened my eyes to liberalism. Have been liberal ever since.

I have been struggling pretty hard academically even though I did fine during high school, Destiny opened my eyes to ADHD after he got diagnosed, thought to myself how successful and productive he was, maybe I also had ADHD but I was able to get by undiagnosed in high school since it was pretty easy for me. Went to a clinic and I got diagnosed with ADHD inattentive-type, I am now trying to figure out medication.
